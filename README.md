# AVLTree-Visualisation

  Mini project to help understand rotation, insertion and deletion from an AVL tree during Algorithms and Data Structures course.

# How to Run

  To visualize AVL tree rotations, insertions, and deletions, follow these steps:

  1. Open the `main.java` file to launch the AVL tree visualization script.
  2. The script allows you to perform insertion and deletion operations on the AVL tree.
